Just a quick solution for understanding what is the source of the query in the logs.
I.e. usual logs usually look like:

  User Load (0.4ms)  SELECT `users`.* FROM `users` WHERE `users`.`id` = 2 LIMIT 1
  Post Load (0.1ma)  SELECT `posts`.* FROM `posts` WHERE `posts`.`user_id` = 2 LIMIT 1

With the gem, they will look like:

  User Load (0.4ms)  SELECT `users`.* FROM `users` WHERE `users`.`id` = 2 LIMIT 1
app/controllers/users_controller.rb:34
  Post Load (0.1ma)  SELECT `posts`.* FROM `posts` WHERE `posts`.`user_id` = 2 LIMIT 1
app/models/user.rb:115
